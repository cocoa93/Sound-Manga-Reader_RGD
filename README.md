# Sound-Manga-Reader_RGD
This is where i'll upload the progress on the sound manga reader pack of Rose Guns Days, this is a passion project i'm doing on my free time so updates may take some time
Season 1 is finished, with ost and sound effects added
-The ost may sometimes fit in one part of a page, but not in the rest of it, this is because the manga of RGD usually merges scenes in the same page.
-The ost may not always be 100% accurate to the original visual novel, mostly because the latter changes tracks frequently in fight scenes and the like, so as to let the pieces be appreciated for more than one page I let them sit around for a bit longer.
-The sound effects may be a little awkward, especially at shootings, this project was made entirely without a budget but i tried my best xD.
-There's a bug in which a sound effect repeats and keeps playing after it's assigned page, in this case, just move forward one page and then return to the bugged one(EX:Page01 plays an SE, it keeps playing on Page02, go to Page03 and then again to Page02).
-Of course, there's no voices added, since RGD never got voice acting outsides of obscure drama CD's.
Season 2 is in progress...
Season 3 is in progress...
Sorrowful Cross Knife is in progress...
Last Season will take longer since i'll have to translate it to english using the already existing french and russian tl's, as well as the original visual novel...
I won't do "Rose Guns Days: Revenge is a Golden Fragrance" since there's no translation of it in any language to my knowledge, not to mention is has no visual novel counterpart, if an english/spanish translation ever comes up i'll be sure to include it here.
